# A Highway Companion App

1. An Interactive And Easy To Use Mobile Application Made On Flutter.
2. Detects The User’s Location And Gives Important Details Like Different Weather Conditions (Temperature, Visibility, Wind Speed Etc.).
3. Gives Information About The Traffic Patterns At That Particular Time At The User’s Location.
4. The App Also Allows Features Like Emergency Calling In Case Of Any On-Road Emergency.

# Implementation

1. The Current Latitude And Longitude Of The User’s Location Is Acquired Using The Package Known As Geolocator And The API Is Called Based On The Acquired Latitude And Longitude By Making HTTP Get Requests.
2. I Have Used Open APIs Like API From OpenWeatherMap For The Getting The Details Of The Current Weather And Traffic API From Tomtom To Get The Details Of Traffic Pattern.
3. For Implementing The Hotlines Or The SOS Calls Another Package Is Used Which Goes By The Name UrlLauncher And All The Numbers Are Provided. The User Just Needs To Select The Service And He/She Can Directly Make The Call Through The Application.
